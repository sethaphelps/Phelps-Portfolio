# Portfolio: Seth Phelps

## Project Description

This homework assignment tasked me with creating a portfolio to utilize in the future when preparing for interviews. Below is a list of items included in the portfolio to help users navigate the webpage.

    - My name and contact information with links to help reach the creator
    - A section about the creator
    - A navigation bar with clickable links that direct you to that specific section of the webpage
    - Application images linked to projects including a larger image for the first application * an assignment requirement *
    - A responsive layout that adapts to the users viewport when using a variety of different devices

This project will be used and modified in the future to house actual applications created by the student.
