# Portfolio: Seth Phelps

## Project Description

In this project I was tasked with creating a web page in the form of a portfolio. This portfolio had requirements for completion which are included below.

    - The student's name and contact information
    - A section about the student
    - A nav bar with clickable links that direct you to that specific section
    - Application images linked to projects
    - A larger image for the first application
    - A responsive layout that adapts to the users viewport

This project will be used and modified in the future to house actual applications created by the student.
