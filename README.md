# Portfolio: Seth Phelps

## Project Description

In this project I was tasked with creating a web page in the form of a portfolio. This portfolio had requirements for completion which are included below.

    - The student's name
    - A section about the creator
    - A nav bar with clickable links that direct you to that specific section
    - Applications linked to projects
    - A larger image for the first application
    - Contact information for the creator
    - A responsive layout that adapts to the users viewport

This project will be used and modified in the future to house actual applications created by the student.
